'''
Chef decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is B, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than B. 
Other than that, he only has one criterion â€” the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. 
Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.

Chef has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are N available tablets, 
numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th tablet has width Wi, height Hi and price Pi.

Help Chef choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine 
that he cannot buy any tablet.
